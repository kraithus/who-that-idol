who-that-idol README.md

I get into a new kpop group, I’m watching the music video, I love her singing, I love her rapping, but I don’t know who she is. I wanna know who she is, I pull up genius lyrics I see the name okay, I know who she is, but she looks different in various scenes, pull up kprofiles, I have the face and the name. Going lyric by lyric matching name and face, excellent.
# manual labor

Extract subtitles from video using ffmpeg
Go to genius lyrics check who singing what line
Creating a file formatted [Idol], below it time matching the sub file for duration she sings her line
Go to kprofiles, download images of each idol from the group, save as idolname.png… yes png, fuck jpeg/jpg, whatever

# code
Use python-mpv
Overlay text and images over video, code is on github
Actual work, access file with idol names and timestamps… access folder with idol pictures. Using the overlay show idol name and image on screen matching current video timestamp with timestamp range in idol-name_timestamp file
Enjoy yourself
